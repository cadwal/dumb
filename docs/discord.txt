How DUMB didn't get its name
----------------------------

   5. THE ELDER MALACLYPSE
          A wandering Wiseman of Ancient Mediterrania ("Med-Terra" or
          middle earth), who followed a 5-pointed Star through the alleys
          of Rome, Damascus, Baghdad, Jerusalem, Mecca and Cairo, bearing
          a sign that seemed to read "DOOM". (This is a misunderstanding.
          The sign actually read "DUMB". Mal-1 is a Non-Prophet.) Patron
          and namesake of Mal-2. Patron of The Season of The Aftermath.
          Holyday: Oct 24.
