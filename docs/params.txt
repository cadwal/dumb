This file tries to shed some light on the mysterious runtime
parameters.  When the menu code gets written, these explanations
should be made accessible with F1 or something.


--player-timer: integer (5)

DUMB tries to adapt to the speed of your machine, but that may not
work perfectly.

If the game seems to be too slow, try increasing this value.  If it's
too fast, do the opposite.

Negative values are not recommended.

--player-forward: integer (18)

Affects how fast you can move forward and backward.  Greater numbers
mean you move slower.

--player-strafe: integer (20)

Affects how fast you can step left and right.  Greater numbers mean
you move slower.

--player-turn: integer (100)

Affects how fast you can turn left and right.  Greater numbers mean
you turn slower.

--player-jump: integer (20)

Should affect how high you can jump.  Greater numbers should mean your
jump is weaker.

However, the current version (0.13.1) lets you jump even when you're
in air already, so you can always keep the key pressed and jump as
high as you want.  This number then affects only how fast you rise in
air.
