aim to monster nearest to screen center, not necessarily closest to player
allow objects to award multiple gettables (eg. MegaSphere)
armor should absorb damage
change sectortype too when changing texture (as with rising bridges)
clear previous map events when switching levels!
configuration menus
continuous sounds for moving sectors
do something about music
finish off heretic protos
fix wall collision checks!
get rid of C++ on big-endian machines
Guile scripts in wads
idspispopd
implement invincibility, light goggles, etc....
implement sectortypes
internationalize
jumping instead of levitation
light areas should be lighter, dark ones darker (0=almost impossible to see)
make a libdumbworld that both dumb and XWad use
make loops over things more efficient perhaps?
mapping
monsters should be smarter
moving vertices, sideways opening & hinged doors
multi-threaded sound driver
runtime choosing of sound bits & channels
scrolling walls
sectors above&below each other
sector shouldn't give damage while player is in air
snapshot.ppm when BPP=1 (8 bits)
sound shouldn't get through closed doors
special shooting
speed up rendering by checking recursively which sectors can be seen?
switching to previous weapon
"Uff!" when the hero runs against a wall
weapon numbering
write documents in Texinfo or something
ctlkey: mouse
ctlkey: look at GGI's General Input Interface
conf: don't forget aadumb settings with xdumb -S, etc.
conf: halt on bogus parameters to enumerated switches
conf: quote special characters in .dumbrc strings
conf: support floating-point entries (for aadumb --vid-gamma)
AA-lib: ASCII snapshot
AA-lib: special handling for AA_RESIZE and AA_MOUSE
AA-lib: more parameters
AA-lib: mouse
AA-lib: use real ticks in autorelease
DOOM: automate 666 effect
DOOM: doors should crush corpses to bloodsplats
DOOM: make player pick up things farther away (like armor in E1M2)
DOOM: monsters should be immune to radiation
DOOM: rising staircases should be slower
DOOM: spheres & suit shouldn't expire so fast
DOOM: staircase doesn't work in E1M8
keymap: alternative keynames; recognize both Shift_L and Shift_R as Shift
keymap: conditional entries like X11:KP_Up AA:8
keymap: keymap_keyname_to_keycode()
X11: KeymapNotify
X11: set icon in program, not in window manager config
X11: turn autorepeat off when window has focus and XKB isn't available
X11: use timestamps from keyboard events
XWad: preview window, could even be a full game
