This corresponds to DUMB 0.09.kn.4, which has not been released
because DUMB 0.10 was released before it.

* Not Yet Implemented:
 - cross compilation (endianness is one reason)
 - srcdir
 - make install
 - full CFLAGS support
 - all #ifdefs

* Installation:

Change to the dumb root directory (so that this file is
./docs/autoconf).

Run "./configure".  If you extracted it from a patch, you may have to
make it executable first.  (man chmod)  A Makefile will be generated.

Run "make".  Put the binaries to suitable places.  A future version
will probably support "make install" to do this automatically.

If you want special features, give parameters to "configure".  Use
--help to get a list of options.  If you give options that
"./configure" doesn't understand, it'll silently ignore them.  Sorry.

* Main options

--help
  The most important option.  Gives you short descriptions for every
  option.

* Graphics options

These options have three states: yes, no, autodetect.  Autodetect is
the default.  It means "configure" will automatically detect if the
required libraries are available.  You can disable graphics drivers
with --without-<name> and force them to be used with --with-<name>.

You can specify as many graphics drivers as you like.  You'll get a
separate game binary for each of them.

--with-aalib, --without-aalib
  Force or disable use of the AALIB graphics library.

--with-ggi, --without-ggi
  Force or disable use of the Generic Graphics Interface.

--with-grx20, --without-grx20
  Force or disable use of the GRX20 graphics library.  I believe this
  library is for DOS only, and "configure" doesn't run in DOS, so this
  option is rather useless.

--with-svgalib, --without-svgalib
  Force or disable use of the SVGALIB (or VGALIB) graphics library.

--with-x, --without-x
  Force or disable use of the X Window System.  If X is used, you'll
  also get binaries for the programs XProtoThing and XWad.  To force
  --with-x, you may have to specify the X include and library
  directories with --x-includes=DIR and --x-libraries=DIR, unless
  "configure" can autodetect them.  (In which case you wouldn't need
  to give --with-x either.)

  The X graphics driver supports a few extensions.  Normally these are
  enabled if the system you're compiling on has the required header
  files, but you can disable them if they give you trouble:

  --disable-dga
    Disable use of the XFree86 Direct Graphics Access extension.

  --disable-xshm
    Disable use of the MIT Shared Memory extension.

  --disable-xkb
    Disable use of the X Keyboard extension.

  These extensions are automatically disabled in runtime if the X
  server doesn't support them or if you tell so in the command line or
  in the configuration file.
 
--with-dummy-video
  The dummy video driver is automatically enabled if all other drivers
  are disabled or unavailable.  Of course you can disable it too.

* Sound options

The sound drivers differ from the video drivers in that you can only
have one of them enabled.  If you force one of them to be used, all
others will be disabled.  As soon as "configure" finds a driver that
it can use, it'll stop looking.

--without-sound
  Disable sound.  Overrides the options below.

--with-uss, --without-uss
  Use the Unix Sound System that was created by Hannu Savolainen for
  Linux and has been ported to BSD at least.  There are free and
  commercial versions of USS; DUMB doesn't care which you have.

--with-mme, --without-mme
  Use the MME library included in Digital Unix.  The interface seems
  to stem from Microsoft Windows, so perhaps this driver could be used
  in a Windows version of DUMB too.

Both sound drivers support these options:

--disable-16bit-sound
  Force 8-bit sound.

--disable-stereo-sound
  Force mono sound.

* Framebuffer options

DUMB supports framebuffers that have 1, 2 or 4 bytes (8, 16 or 32
bits) per pixel.  The renderer is compiled for each BPP value
separately, the versions are all linked together, and DUMB will choose
the right one when run.  If you don't need support for some BPP value,
you can leave it out to speed up compilation:

--disable-1bpp
  Disable support of framebuffers with 1 byte (8 bits) per pixel.

--disable-2bpp
  Disable support of framebuffers with 2 bytes (16 bits) per pixel.

--disable-4bpp
  Disable support of framebuffers with 4 bytes (32 bits) per pixel.

If you disable all BPPs, "configure" will warn you but continue.  The
game can't then be played.

* Networking

This is like sound; you can only choose one of these options.
Currently, only Unix networking (Berkeley sockets) is supported.

--without-net
  Disable networking.  Actually, this uses a dummy network driver, but
  you don't have to care of that.

--with-unix-net, --without-unix-net
  Force or disable master-slave Unix networking.  This uses UDP
  datagrams and system calls gethostbyname(), htons(), socket(),
  bind(), fcntl(), close(), recvfrom(), select() and sendto().
