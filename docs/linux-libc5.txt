On Debian GNU/Linux 2.0, you can compile DUMB for libc5.  You must
first install altgcc and all appropriate altdev and oldlibs packages.
Then run configure like this:

CC=i486-linuxlibc1-gcc CXX=i486-linuxlibc1-g++ \
configure --x-libraries=/usr/lib/libc5-compat

Note especially the --x-libraries part!  If you leave that out, the
configure script looks around for the libraries and finds the libc6
versions in /usr/X11R6/lib.

There's nothing DUMB-specific in this command; it should work with
other packages as well.
