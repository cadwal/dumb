Actually, I made these questions up.  But here they are, in case
someone asks them.

Q1. Why does it use -I. -I. -I.. -I.. when compiling?

Q2. What do xlace and ylace mean?

* Q1. Why does it use -I. -I. -I.. -I.. when compiling?

The first -I. isn't actually necessary but Automake puts it there.

The second -I. refers to the source directory.  It differs from the
first one when you are doing a VPATH build (see configure.txt).

The first -I.. refers to the top build directory where config.h is.

The second -I.. refers to the top source directory so that #include
"libdumbutil/fixed.h" works.  This is the only -I switch added by
Makefile.am files of DUMB itself.

* Q2. What do xlace and ylace mean?

Here xmul=6, ymul=7, xlace=2 and ylace=3.
