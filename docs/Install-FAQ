Q1. DUMB compiles and installs fine but the executables are huge.
Could you make the Makefile strip them?

Q2. Why does it use -I. -I. -I.. -I.. -I../libmissing -I../intl
when compiling?

* Q1. DUMB compiles and installs fine but the executables are huge.

Use the install-strip target.

$ make install-strip

The GNU Coding Standards say that executables shouldn't be stripped by
default, and Automake makes it easy for me to follow that rule.

* Q2. Why does it use -I. -I. -I.. -I.. -I../libmissing -I../intl
when compiling?

The first -I. isn't actually necessary but Automake puts it there.

The second -I. refers to the source directory.  It differs from the
first one when you are doing a VPATH build (see configure.txt).

The first -I.. refers to the top build directory where config.h is.

The second -I.. refers to the top source directory so that #include
"libdumbutil/fixed.h" works.

-I../libmissing is needed for replacing header files the system may
lack.

-I../intl is for libintl.h in GNU gettext.
