* Highest-priority queue:
aadumb doesn't build when using configure --without-x
finish libdumbworldb
separate renderer from rest of code again
speed up rendering by checking recursively which sectors can be seen
fix wall collision checks

* Later:
activation
aim to monster nearest to screen center, not necessarily closest to player
allow objects to award multiple gettables (eg. MegaSphere)
allow using the same sprites for things and icons
armor should absorb damage
BPP should always mean Bits Per Pixel
center DUMB logo vertically (just look at aadumb)
clean up shm on fatal signals
configuration menus
confirm quitting (use the menu code)
continuous sounds for moving sectors
do something about music
echoes in sewers
end-level statistics (secret%, kill%, collect%, hit%)
finish off heretic protos
fix DGA
fix end of level in network game
flow control in aadumb (now it lags horribly at 9600bps)
get rid of C++ on big-endian machines
get rid of alarm(), use select() instead
get rid of all arbitrary limits
Guile scripts in wads
implement invincibility, light goggles, etc....
implement sectortypes (partially done)
inventory items (may already have some of the code for this?)
jumping instead of levitation
light areas should be lighter, dark ones darker (0=almost impossible to see)
loading & saving
long options, including --help and --version in all programs
make --dumb-xmul 3 --dumb-ymul 1 work
make loops over things more efficient perhaps?  (in libdumbworldb)
mapping
menus
mipmapping
monsters should be smarter
move bpp-independent code to rendcommon.c
moving vertices, sideways opening & hinged doors
multi-threaded sound driver
network games that anyone can join
polymorphing to a monster (like in Nethack!)
scale weapons & gettable icons if framebuffer is small
sectors above&below each other
sector shouldn't give damage while player is in air
snapshot.ppm when BPP=1 (8 bits)
sound shouldn't get through closed doors
special shooting
truecolor textures
tunneling
"Uff!" when the hero runs against a wall or falls
use function keys for special commands, select weapons with numbers
use PNG instead of PPM
use regular fixed point instead of UNIT_SPEED
version number of doom4dum.wad
weapon numbering
write documents in Texinfo or something
AA-lib: ASCII snapshot
AA-lib: special handling for AA_RESIZE and AA_MOUSE
AA-lib: three-state boolean parameters
AA-lib: use real ticks in autorelease
ctlkey: mouse
ctlkey: look at GGI's General Input Interface
conf: don't forget aadumb settings with xdumb -S, etc.
conf: dynamic enumerations (like for AA-lib fonts)
conf: halt on bogus parameters to enumerated switches
conf: quote special characters in .dumbrc strings
conf: support floating-point entries (for aadumb --vid-gamma)
Doom: automate 666 effect
Doom: backpack should double carrying capacity
Doom: don't get Health>100% with medikits and stimpaks
Doom: doors should crush corpses to bloodsplats
Doom: imps should not be able to kill each other with fireballs (ImmuneToSuch)
Doom: make player pick up things farther away (like armor in E1M2)
Doom: monsters should be immune to radiation
Doom: rising staircases should be slower
Doom: spheres & suit shouldn't expire so fast
Doom: staircase doesn't work in E1M8
keymap: alternative keynames; recognize both Shift_L and Shift_R as Shift
keymap: conditional entries like X11:KP_Up AA:8
keymap: keymap_keyname_to_keycode()
ptcomp: output a WAD
wadtool: --verbose
X11: KeymapNotify
X11: set icon in program, not in window manager config
X11: turn autorepeat off when window has focus and XKB isn't available
X11: use timestamps from keyboard events
XWad: preview window, could even be a full game
