* Highest-priority queue:
rewrite libdumbworldb in C++, but don't get too excited
separate renderer from rest of code again
speed up rendering by checking recursively which sectors can be seen
fix wall collision checks

* Later:
activation of walls, ceilings, things
aim to monster nearest to screen center, not necessarily closest to player
let fleshy walls and flats bleed when hit
compile as C++ on little-endian machines too
continuous sounds for moving sectors
end-level statistics (secret%, kill%, collect%, hit%)
finish off heretic protos
get rid of alarm(), use select() instead
get rid of all arbitrary limits
gettables which give other gettables (like health) when used
Guile or Pliant scripts in wads
implement light goggles, etc....
implement sectortypes (partially done)
jumping instead of levitation
mapping
move bpp-independent code to rendcommon.c
moving vertices, sideways opening & hinged doors
polymorphing to a monster (like in Nethack!)
sector shouldn't give damage while player is in air
snapshot.ppm when BPP=1 (8 bits)
sound shouldn't get through closed doors
special shooting
support PPM_PACKCOLORS
turning inertia control
"Uff!" when the hero runs against a wall or falls
use function keys for special commands, select weapons with numbers
use regular fixed point instead of UNIT_SPEED
weapon numbering
