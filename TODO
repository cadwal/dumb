* Highest-priority queue:
fix all configure/compile/install bugs
finish libdumbworldb
separate renderer from rest of code again
speed up rendering by checking recursively which sectors can be seen
fix wall collision checks

* Later:
activation
aim to monster nearest to screen center, not necessarily closest to player
allow each level to specify its own LEVINFO, PROTOS and PHASES
allow objects to award multiple gettables (eg. MegaSphere)
armor should absorb damage
center DUMB logo vertically (just look at aadumb)
compile as C++ on little-endian machines too
continuous sounds for moving sectors
documentation
end-level statistics (secret%, kill%, collect%, hit%)
finish off heretic protos
gamma control from keyboard
get rid of alarm(), use select() instead
get rid of all arbitrary limits
Guile scripts in wads
implement invincibility, light goggles, etc....
implement sectortypes (partially done)
inventory items (may already have some of the code for this?)
jumping instead of levitation
light areas should be lighter, dark ones darker (0=almost impossible to see)
long options, including --help and --version in all programs
make --dumb-xmul 3 --dumb-ymul 1 work
make loops over things more efficient perhaps?  (in libdumbworldb)
mapping
monsters should be smarter
move bpp-independent code to rendcommon.c
moving vertices, sideways opening & hinged doors
polymorphing to a monster (like in Nethack!)
rename ldltest to dwdbtest
sector shouldn't give damage while player is in air
snapshot.ppm when BPP=1 (8 bits)
sound shouldn't get through closed doors
special shooting
support PPM_PACKCOLORS
tunneling (in libdumbworldb)
turning inertia control
"Uff!" when the hero runs against a wall or falls
use function keys for special commands, select weapons with numbers
use PNG instead of PPM
use regular fixed point instead of UNIT_SPEED
weapon numbering
write documents in Texinfo or something
